/**
 * struct list_head - Head and node of a doubly-linked list
 * @prev: pointer to the previous node in the list
 * @next: pointer to the next node in the list
 *
 * The simple doubly-linked list consists of a head and nodes attached to
 * this head. Both node and head share the same struct type. The list_*
 * functions and macros can be used to access and modify this data structure.
 *
 * The @prev pointer of the list head points to the last list node of the
 * list and @next points to the first list node of the list. For an empty list,
 * both member variables point to the head.
 *
 * The list nodes are usually embedded in a container structure which holds the
 * actual data. Such container structure is called entry. The helper list_entry
 * can be used to calculate the structure address from the address of the node.
